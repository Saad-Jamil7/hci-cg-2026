<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm <strong>Saad Jamil</strong>. This is my Week 05 submission for CS-555. The goal is to demonstrate semantic HTML and explain HCI concepts from the course book.</p>

<h2>What is HCI? (Page #3–4)</h2>
<p>Human–computer interaction has roots in disciplines like ergonomics and human factors. It became a distinct field as computers became widespread.</p>
<p><strong>HCI involves the design, implementation and evaluation of interactive systems in the context of the user's task and work.</strong></p>
<p><em>Reference: Dix et al., p. 3-4</em></p>

<h2>Short-Term Memory & Chunking (Page #29–30)</h2>
<p>Short-term memory has limited capacity: about 7 ± 2 items. More accurately, we remember 7 ± 2 <strong>chunks</strong>—meaningful groups of information.</p>
<p><strong>Design implication:</strong> Group related items into chunks so users don't have to memorize long lists.</p>
<p><em>Reference: Dix et al., p. 29-30</em></p>

<h2>Fitts' Law (Chapter 1)</h2>
<p>The time to hit a target depends on its distance and size. This is formalized as <em>T = a + b log₂(D/S + 1)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Design implication:</strong> Make important controls larger and place them closer to reduce selection time.</p>
<p><em>Reference: Dix et al., Chapter 1</em></p>
